# Routes

This application has a few different routes. Unfortunately, we don't have site wide consistency as e do possess a mix of Next.js routes and tRPC routes. Initially, we decided to use tRPC and that is our favoured approach still but we found using Next.js routes for the UPstash schedules was easier to integrate and enabled out of te box authentication.
