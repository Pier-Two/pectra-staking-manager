# Overview

The Pectra staking management platform has been developed by Labrys in conjunction with Pier Two.

---

This app aims to assist with the 3 following flows:

- Consolidations
- Deposits
- Withdrawals

Deposits aren't a new addition to this upgrade, but this upgrade does increase the `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE` of validators so that having more than 32 ETH in a single validator isn't a waste of money.
