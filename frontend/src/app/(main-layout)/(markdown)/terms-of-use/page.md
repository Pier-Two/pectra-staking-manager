# Pectra \- Website Terms & Conditions

By accessing or continuing to use our Website and related services, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions, including our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any of these terms, or the terms of our privacy policy, you should cease using our Website.

**Last Updated: 2 May 2025**

## 1. General

1. Your continued use of our Website indicates your agreement to these terms and conditions of use (**Website Terms**).
2. Please read the following Website Terms to understand your rights and obligations when accessing our Website.
3. For the purposes of these Website Terms, the "**Services**" refer to the features and functionalities of the Pectra staking manager that are made available through the Website, which is a web-based user interface (**UI**) designed to facilitate user-initiated interactions with Ethereum staking smart contracts. The Services may be updated from time to time and include the following functionality:
   1. upgrading validator withdrawal credentials from the legacy Ethereum-native 0x01 format to the Ethereum-native 0x02 format;
   2. consolidating multiple existing validators into a single validator using 0x02 credentials;
   3. making on-chain ETH transactions to top up existing validator balances; and
   4. performing validator withdrawals, including partial reward withdrawals and full validator exits, as supported by the Ethereum protocol.
4. These actions allow users to manage validator operations in line with Ethereum network upgrades and best practices, particularly surrounding the transition to the 0x02 withdrawal credential format.
5. In addition, the Services include access to network-level visualizations and metrics, which may be displayed in the UI to aid user decision-making. These may incorporate, but are not limited to:
   1. Charts showing validator distribution across withdrawal credential types (e.g., 0x00, 0x01, 0x02); and
   2. Statistics reflecting credential migration trends and aggregated upgrade progress.
6. To enhance usability, the Pectra Staking Manager integrates with publicly available centralized API services such as [beaconcha.in](http://beaconcha.in). These integrations support a smoother user experience by:
   1. automatically retrieving and displaying validators associated with a connected Ethereum wallet address; and
   2. prefilling relevant information in the UI to reduce manual steps and errors.
7. Please be aware that these third-party APIs may involve external data transmissions. For further details, refer to our Privacy Policy.
8. Additionally, users may opt into an email notification feature, and the terms of our Privacy Policy apply to this email notification feature. Users may opt out of this at any time by clicking "unsubscribe" or by emailing the Privacy Officer using the details in the Privacy Policy. When selected, this allows users to receive automated notices upon completion of validator management tasks (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, or upgrade confirmation). This functionality is entirely optional and is intended to improve user experience, especially during asynchronous blockchain confirmations.
9. By browsing or accessing our Website, you agree to be bound by these Website Terms and acknowledge that you have read and understood them.
10. We run this Website and provide the Services as a public good and take no fees or profits from doing so.
11. We may need to amend these Website Terms from time to time. Amendments will be effective as soon as such changes are notified on the Website. Your continued use of the Website and our Services following such notification constitutes agreement by you to be bound by these Website Terms as amended.
12. You should regularly review these Website Terms. Where there is inconsistency between the content on the Website and these Website Terms, the Website Terms shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.
13. These Website Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to their subject matter and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between you and us in connection with the Website and Services.
