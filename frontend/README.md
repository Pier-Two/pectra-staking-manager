When a user connects to consolidate their validators, they are presented with a list of validators linked to their evm wallet (data provided by the ).

They can choose one of these validators to consolidate all of their other validators to.

In order to consolidate to a validator, both the target and source validators must be validator versions 0x02.

A user can also enter validator to consolidate to by validator index or BLS public key - but if the entered validator is not version 0x02, they cannot consolidate to this validator.
